# Auth0 Configuration Setup

The authentication routing issue has been identified and temporarily fixed. The root cause was that Auth0 environment variables contained placeholder values instead of actual Auth0 configuration.

## Current Status
- ✅ Dashboard is now accessible without authentication (development mode)
- ✅ Yellow warning banner indicates Auth0 is not configured
- ✅ App functions normally for testing purposes

## To Enable Full Authentication:

### 1. Create Auth0 Account
1. Go to [Auth0.com](https://auth0.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new application (Single Page Application)
3. Note down your Domain, Client ID, and optionally create an API for the Audience

### 2. Configure Auth0 Application Settings
In your Auth0 dashboard:
- **Allowed Callback URLs**: `http://localhost:5173, https://your-production-domain.com`
- **Allowed Logout URLs**: `http://localhost:5173, https://your-production-domain.com`
- **Allowed Web Origins**: `http://localhost:5173, https://your-production-domain.com`

### 3. Update Environment Variables
Replace the placeholder values in `.env` with your actual Auth0 configuration:

```env
# Auth0 Configuration (Frontend - VITE_ prefix required)
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-actual-domain.auth0.com
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-actual-client-id
VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your-api-identifier  # Optional, for API access
VITE_AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173
```

### 4. Restart Development Server
After updating the environment variables:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Issue Identified**: Auth0 environment variables contained placeholder values (`your-auth0-domain.auth0.com`, etc.)
2. **Temporary Solution**: Added Auth0 bypass for development that provides mock authentication context
3. **Result**: Dashboard now renders correctly without authentication errors

## Next Steps

1. Configure proper Auth0 credentials (see above)
2. Test authentication flow with real Auth0 setup
3. Remove development bypass once Auth0 is properly configured
4. Deploy to production with proper environment variables

The app is now functional for development and testing purposes!
